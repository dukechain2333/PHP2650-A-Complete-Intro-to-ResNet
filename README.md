# A Complete Introduction to ResNet

This is the final project of PHP 2650 Statistical Learning and Big Data. This project aims to provide a complete introduction to ResNet,
a deep learning model that has been widely used in computer vision tasks. It was conducted by [William Qian](https://github.com/dukechain2333) and [Dingxuan Zhang](https://github.com/dz6190918).

## What is ResNet?

ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a deep learning model that was proposed by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun in 2015.
ResNet is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is widely used in computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

## Why we choose ResNet?

ResNet used to be a breakthrough in the field of deep learning. It solved the problem of accuracy degradation and verify the
idea that the deeper network should have better performance. It was once widely used in various computer vision tasks and has been
the basis of many other deep learning models. Although Transformer has become the most popular deep learning model in recent years,
it is still necessary to understand the basic principles of ResNet.

## Project Structure

As you can see in the navigation bar, this project is divided into several sections.

The first section is the **Basic Theory** section, in this section, we will provide basic theories that will be used in the ResNet, and we will also
introduce the basic structure of ResNet in this section.

The second section is the **Experiments** section. In this section, we analyze the attributes of ResNet through experiments.
Also, an implementation of ResNet using PyTorch will be provided in this section.

The third section is the **Advanced Topics** section. A practical application of ResNet and a variant of ResNet will be introduced in this section.
