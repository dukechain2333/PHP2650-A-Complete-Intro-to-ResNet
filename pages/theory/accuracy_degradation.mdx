# Accuracy Degradation

## What is accuracy degradation?

The concept of accuracy degradation was mentioned at the very beginning of ["Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780459).
The authors start with a simple question: "Is learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers?", and state that when deeper networks are able to start converging, a degradation problem has been exposed: with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated and then degrades rapidly.

Surprisingly, this deterioration is not due to overfitting, and incorporating additional layers into an already deep model results in increased training errors.
This decline in training accuracy suggests that not all systems are equally easy to optimize.

## Why does this happen?

A simple explanation for this phenomenon is that when model A (say it has n layers) has reached the best accuracy, adding more layers to it (model B) should be able to achieve the same accuracy as model A,
which means level after n are all identity mappings. However, that is a very hard constraint to satisfy, thus causing accuracy degradation.
