# A Complete Introduction to ResNet

This is the final project of PHP 2650 Statistical Learning and Big Data. This project aims to provide a complete introduction to ResNet,
a deep learning model that has been widely used in computer vision tasks. It was conducted by [William Qian](https://github.com/dukechain2333) and [Dingxuan Zhang](https://github.com/dz6190918).

## What is ResNet?

## Why we choose ResNet?

## Project Structure

As you can see in the navigation bar, this project is divided into several sections.

The first section is the **Theory** section, in this section, we will provide a detailed introduction to the theory of ResNet. We will explain the concepts that involved in ResNet, such as the structure of ResNet, the bottleneck structure, the residual block, and the skip connection.

The second section is the **Implementation** section, in this section, we will provide a detailed introduction to the implementation of ResNet. We will explain how to implement ResNet using PyTorch.
