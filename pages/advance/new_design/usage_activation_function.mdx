# Usage of Activation Functions

Next, we will examine the impact of $f$ function. We want to make f an identity mapping, which is done by re-arranging
the activation functions (ReLU and/or BN). Several networks are built as follows:

<div style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 10,
    marginBottom: 10
}}>
    <Image src="/usage-activation.png" alt="usage-activation" width={1000} height={800}/>
</div>

The results are shown below:

<div style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 10,
    marginBottom: 10
}}>
    <Image src="/usage-activation-result.png" alt="usage-activation-result" width={1000} height={800}/>
</div>

Somehow surprisingly, when BN and ReLU are both used as pre-activation, the results are improved by healthy margins.
This design brings two benefits.

The first benefit is that this design can **ease the optimization**. As we can see in the following picture, the curve of the
proposed model converges faster than the original model.

<div style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 10,
    marginBottom: 10
}}>
    <Image src="/usage-activation-opt.png" alt="usage-activation-opt" width={1000} height={800}/>
</div>

The second advantage is its potential to **reduce overfitting**. As depicted, the pre-activation model achieves a
marginally higher training loss upon convergence but exhibits a lower test error. This improvement is attributed to the
regularization effect of Batch Normalization (BN). In the original model, even though BN normalizes the signal,
it is immediately combined with the shortcut, resulting in a non-normalized merged signal. This non-normalized signal then serves
as the input for the subsequent weight layer. In contrast, in the pre-activation model, the inputs to all weight layers are normalized.

<div style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 10,
    marginBottom: 10
}}>
