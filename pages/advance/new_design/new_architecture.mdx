# New Architecture

Based on the previous analysis and experiments, we can make the conclusion that identity shortcut connections and identity
after-addition activation are essential for making information propagation smooth.

Thus, this new architecture is proposed to improve the performance of the ResNet model. The new architecture is shown in the following figure.

<div style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 10,
    marginBottom: 10
